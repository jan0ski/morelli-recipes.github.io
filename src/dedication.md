# Dedication
> Thank you to my Parents; Grandparents; and generations of Aunts, Uncles, and cousins that have contributed to the love and memories held within in this book. I hold our Chrismas traditions (and general celebration of family with food) extremely close to my heart. I constantly find myself in the place Aunt Barbara describes in the note left in my copy when I was just a year old:
>> *Tommy - </br>
>> To our youngest great-nephew. Some day, when you are a grown man, with a family of your own, look at this book and remember your Aunts, Uncles & Mom-Mom & Pop-Pop. We Love you.*
>
> With the rollercoaster this year has been, and the resulting distance it has created between all loved ones, I hope this digital version of Aunt Barbara's cherished book helps make us all feel a little closer. I've attempted to keep all of the original content just the way it is, but please let me know if anything is out of place. I hope you all enjoy, Merry Christmas.

## Mary Talone
>My Mother has been the most influential person in my life. Mary Nancy Talone was born to Nellie and William Talone in 1916. After marrying Joseph Morelli, her life was dedicated to her husband and six children, Bobby, Toni, Diane, Barbara, Billy, and Joey. Her life continues to touch each one of her children, grand children and great grand children through her wonderful recipes. 
>
>My brothers and sisters and I an continue to prepare some of our 1 favorite dishes of day's gone by;Â· Riviola's, Meatballs, Antipasto, Pizzelles ... This book is a collection of those wonderful recipes, for our children and grandchildren. It is a tribute to a wonderful lady, my mother.

## Aunt Marie
>I couldn't write this book and leave out Aunt Marie. My father's sister, my mother's best friend and our dear aunt. Her funny ways and big heart will always stay with me in my wonderful memories of her. All of my brothers and sisters have their own special "Aunt Marie" stories they could tell, but one thing we all would agree on is what a great cook she was. I can still remember how happy it made her to have us visit for a wonderful Italian supper, or for her to be a prut of our family gatherings. 
>
>I wanted to share something special; so I have printed these copies of two recipe cards that Aunt Marie had given to me. We have all eaten her pizzelles on many a holiday. The ranger cookies were one of her favorites. Enjoy! Thanks Aunt Marie.
