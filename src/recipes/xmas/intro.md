# Christmas - Past, Present, & Future 
Christmas is a time of love, friendships, giving, and food, food, food! Growing up an Italian, traditions were an important part of our holidays. Every Christmas eve, preparations were underway as my mother cooked our annual Christmas eve feast. Years past, the menu was vast, with numerous fish entree's. The menu that follows is that of a typical Christmas eve dinner at the Morelli house. Christmas eve continues to be a traditional event in our family, whether it is in New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia or North Carolina, our mother's influence touches us all. These recipes are for the Christmas' Future, for the Tom's, Tim's, Bill's, Amy's, Robin's, Nicoles', Morgan's, Michael's, Mathew's, Nicholas' and Jordan's.

If only one piece of our traditions are passed on, my mother will live forever.
