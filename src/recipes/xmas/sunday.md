# Sunday Dinners
Being Italian, pasta played a very important role in the weekly meal planning. One thing was certain, every Sunday, a big pot of spaghetti sauce was cooked to serve any number of guests for dinner. My mother would always have the sauce cooking when we would awake, the smells were delightful. Meatballs frying, the aroma of the tomatoes, basil and garlic, we could hardly wait for dinner. I can remember, many a Sunday, coming home from church. It was wonderful to sneak a slice of bread, spread it with sauce, grated cheese and feast.

As I now reminisce, Sunday Dinner's are one of the things I miss most.
