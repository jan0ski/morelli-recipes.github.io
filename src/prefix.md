>Thank you to my Parents; Grandparents; and generations of Aunts, Uncles, and cousins that have contributed to the love and memories held within in this book. I hold our Chrismas traditions (and general celebration of family with food) extremely close to my heart. I am incredibly thankful I was able to get my own copy - even if I was only 1 year old at the time! With the rollercoaster this year has been, and the resulting distance it has created between all loved ones, I hope this digital version of Aunt Barbara's cherished book helps make us all feel a little closer. Hope you all enjoy, Merry Christmas.
