# Just Desserts
>I couldnt finish this book without thanking my husband, Tom. His support and encouragement helped to make this a labor of live. From the beinning of July, when I first decided to write this cook book, until mid-December when it went to press, Tom kept me going with his wonderful ideas as each page unfolded. I know it meant as much to him as it did for me to remember my my mother and share these wonderful recipes with our family and friends.

>And to my brothers and sisters, this is for you, for your children and for their children. I hope this book brings you all the joy and happinenss it has brought me in writing it.
