Spaghetti has been popular in America for about 75 years. The wave of immigration from Southern Italy which began in the '20's, first introduced spaghetti to America. The poor people from the south had been accustomed to a fairly steady diet of spaghetti, and it was not long before a few Italian restaurants were opened. Spaghetti was served, not only because it was the first thing a Italian would think of, but more importantly, it was a quick and easy dish for the most inexperience of cooks to prepare.
